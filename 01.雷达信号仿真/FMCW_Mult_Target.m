%% Radar Signal Simulation
% As briefly mentioned in earlier sections, an FMCW radar measures the
% range by examining the beat frequency in the dechirped signal. To extract
% this frequency, a dechirp operation is performed by mixing the received
% signal with the transmitted signal. After the mixing, the dechirped
% signal contains only individual frequency components that correspond to
% the target range.
% 
% In addition, even though it is possible to extract the Doppler
% information from a single sweep, the Doppler shift is often extracted
% among several sweeps because within one pulse, the Doppler frequency is
% indistinguishable from the beat frequency. To measure the range and
% Doppler, an FMCW radar typically performs the following operations:
%
% # The waveform generator generates the FMCW signal.
% # The transmitter and the antenna amplify the signal and radiate the
% signal into space.
% # The signal propagates to the target, gets reflected by the target, and
% travels back to the radar.
% # The receiving antenna collects the signal.
% # The received signal is dechirped and saved in a buffer.
% # Once a certain number of sweeps fill the buffer, the Fourier transform
% is performed in both range and Doppler to extract the beat frequency as
% well as the Doppler shift. One can then estimate the range and speed of
% the target using these results. Range and Doppler can also be shown as an
% image and give an intuitive indication of where the target is in the
% range and speed domain.
%
% The next section simulates the process outlined above. A total of 64
% sweeps are simulated and a range Doppler response is generated at the
% end.
%
% During the simulation, a spectrum analyzer is used to show the spectrum
% of each received sweep as well as its dechirped counterpart.
%这个也不怎么明白？？？？

    xr(:,m) = xd;                             % Buffer the dechirped signal
end


%%
% From the spectrum scope, one can see that although the received signal is
% wideband (channel 1), sweeping through the entire bandwidth, the
% dechirped signal becomes narrowband (channel 2). 

%% Range and Doppler Estimation
% Before estimating the value of the range and Doppler, it may be a good
% idea to take a look at the zoomed range Doppler response of all
% 64 sweeps.

hrdresp = phased.RangeDopplerResponse('PropagationSpeed',c,...
    'DopplerOutput','Speed','OperatingFrequency',fc,'SampleRate',fs,...
    'RangeMethod','FFT','SweepSlope',sweep_slope,...
    'RangeFFTLengthSource','Property','RangeFFTLength',2048,...
    'DopplerFFTLengthSource','Property','DopplerFFTLength',256);
% 
clf;
plotResponse(hrdresp,xr)                 % Plot range Doppler map
axis([-v_max v_max 0 range_max])
clim = caxis;
% 
% %%
% % From the range Doppler response, one can see that the car in front is a
% % bit more than 40 m away and appears almost static. This is expected
% % because the radial speed of the car relative to the radar is only 4 km/h,
% % which translates to a mere 1.11 m/s.
% %
% % There are many ways to estimate the range and speed of the target car.
% % For example, one can choose almost any spectral analysis method to
% % extract both the beat frequency and the Doppler shift. This example uses
% % the root MUSIC algorithm to extract both the beat frequency and the
% % Doppler shift.
% %
% % As a side note, although the received signal is sampled at 150 MHz so the
% % system can achieve the required range resolution, after the dechirp, one
% % only needs to sample it at a rate that corresponds to the maximum beat
% % frequency. Since the maximum beat frequency is in general less than the
% % required sweeping bandwidth, the signal can be decimated to alleviate the
% % hardware cost. The following code snippet shows the decimation process.
% 
% Dn = fix(fs/(2*fb_max));
% for m = size(xr,2):-1:1
%     xr_d(:,m) = decimate(xr(:,m),Dn,'FIR');
% end
% fs_d = fs/Dn;
% % 
% %%
% % To estimate the range, firstly, the beat frequency is estimated using the
% % coherently integrated sweeps and then converted to the range.
% 
% fb_rng = rootmusic(pulsint(xr_d,'coherent'),1,fs_d);
% rng_est = beat2range(fb_rng,sweep_slope,c)
% 
% 
% %%
% % Second, the Doppler shift is estimated across the sweeps at the range
% % where the target is present.
% 
% peak_loc = val2ind(rng_est,c/(fs_d*2));
% fd = -rootmusic(xr_d(peak_loc,:),1,1/tm);
% v_est = dop2speed(fd,lambda)/2
% 
% 
% %%
% % Note that both range and Doppler estimation are quite accurate.
% 
% %% Range Doppler Coupling Effect
% % One issue associated with linear FM signals, such as an FMCW signal, is
% % the range Doppler coupling effect. As discussed earlier, the target range
% % corresponds to the beat frequency. Hence, an accurate range estimation
% % depends on an accurate estimate of beat frequency. However, the presence
% % of Doppler shift changes the beat frequency, resulting in a biased range
% % estimation. 
% %
% % For the situation outlined in this example, the range error caused by the
% % relative speed between the target and the radar is
% 
% deltaR = rdcoupling(fd,sweep_slope,c)
% 
% %%
% % This error is so small that we can safely ignore it. 
% % 
% % Even though the current design is achieving the desired performance, one
% % parameter warrants further attention. In the current configuration, the
% % sweep time is about 7 microseconds. Therefore, the system needs to sweep
% % a 150 MHz band within a very short period. Such an automotive radar may
% % not be able to meet the cost requirement. Besides, given the velocity of
% % a car, there is no need to make measurements every 7 microseconds. Hence,
% % automotive radars often use a longer sweep time. For example, the
% % waveform used in [2] has the same parameters as the waveform designed in
% % this example except a sweep time of 2 ms.
% %
% % A longer sweep time makes the range Doppler coupling more prominent. To
% % see this effect, first reconfigure the waveform to use 2 ms as the sweep
% % time.
% 
% hwavtr = clone(hwav);
% release(hwavtr);
% tm = 2e-3;
% hwavtr.SweepTime = tm;
% sweep_slope = bw/tm;

%%
% Now calculate the range Doppler coupling. 

% deltaR = rdcoupling(fd,sweep_slope,c)

%%
% A range error of 1.14 m can no longer be ignored and needs to be
% compensated. Naturally, one may think of doing so following the same
% procedure outlined in earlier sections, estimating both range and
% Doppler, figuring out the range Doppler coupling from the Doppler shift,
% and then remove the error from the estimate.
%
% Unfortunately this process doesn't work very well with the long sweep
% time. The longer sweep time results in a lower sampling rate across the
% sweeps, thus reducing the radar's capability of unambiguously detecting
% high speed vehicles. For instance, using a sweep time of 2 ms, the
% maximum unambiguous speed the radar system can detect using the
% traditional Doppler processing is

% v_unambiguous = dop2speed(1/(2*tm),lambda)/2

%%
% The unambiguous speed is only 0.48 m/s, which means that the relative
% speed, 1.11 m/s, cannot be unambiguously detected. This means that not
% only the target car will appear slower in Doppler processing, the range
% Doppler coupling also cannot be correctly compensated.
%
% One way to resolve such ambiguity without Doppler processing is to adopt
% a triangle sweep pattern. Next section shows how the triangle sweep
% addresses the issue.
